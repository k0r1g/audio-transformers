Goal:

Tues: we finish emotional detection text-to-speech 
Wed: we fine-tune csm's text-to-speech 
Thurs: we add a llm, build the speech-to-speech 



Question, can this model also do emotion classification for translation not just transcription  


 
 10-11: 
 - do the evlaute script 
 - do the inference script 
 
 11-12:
 - train the whisper tiny model 
 - evaluate 
 - run inference 
 
 during training: 

 - go back and add shapes everywhere 
 - add our test scripts 

12-1: 
- build streamlit 
- deploy model on our streamlit
